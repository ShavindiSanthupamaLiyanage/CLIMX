    <h2>UN Climate Conferences (COPs)</h2>
    <p>Every year, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) brings together 198 Parties to
        discuss and implement measures to combat climate change. The Conference of the Parties (COP) serves as the
        primary decision-making body under the UNFCCC, where nations negotiate agreements and assess progress toward
        global climate goals. Since the first COP in Berlin, Germany (1995), these conferences have played a pivotal
        role in shaping climate policies, leading to crucial treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris
        Agreement (2015).</p>
    <p>Each COP is hosted by a different country, following a rotation system among the five UN regional groups. These
        conferences have set global milestones by addressing issues like carbon emission reduction, renewable energy
        transition, and climate adaptation strategies. Below is an overview of five significant COPs and their
        objectives.</p>

            <h3>COP29 (2024) – Baku, Azerbaijan</h3>
            <p>COP29, held in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024, focused heavily on climate finance as a means to
                accelerate global climate action. The conference concluded with a significant agreement emphasizing the
                responsibility of developed nations to provide substantial financial assistance to developing countries.
                The agreement, finalized on 24 November 2024, calls for developed nations to deliver at least $300
                billion per year by 2035 to help developing countries mitigate climate change and adapt to its worsening
                effects.</p>
            <p>While the agreement was a crucial step forward, UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed concerns
                that it fell short of the level of ambition needed to address the global climate crisis. However, it was
                recognized as an essential foundation for future negotiations and progress.</p>

    <h2>Key Climate Agreements</h2>
    <p>International climate agreements play a crucial role in addressing global environmental challenges by setting
        legally binding targets and fostering cooperation among nations. Three landmark treaties—the Kyoto Protocol,
        the Paris Agreement, and the Montreal Protocol—have significantly shaped global efforts to combat climate
        change.
    </p>
    <p>The Kyoto Protocol introduced the first legally binding commitments for developed nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement built upon this by uniting countries in a collective effort to limit global temperature rise. Meanwhile, the Montreal Protocol has been instrumental in protecting the ozone layer by phasing out harmful substances. Together, these agreements demonstrate the international community’s commitment to environmental sustainability.</p>

                    differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities" (CBDR-RC).</p>
                <p>The first commitment period (2008–2012) required 37 industrialized nations and the EU to reduce
                    emissions by 5% below 1990 levels. The Doha Amendment (2012) introduced a second commitment period
                    (2013–2020) with an enhanced reduction target of at least 18% below 1990 levels.</p>
                <p>Key mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>International Emissions Trading (IET)</strong> – Allowing the trading of emission permits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)</strong> – Supporting green projects in developing nations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Joint Implementation (JI)</strong> – Enabling countries to invest in emission reduction projects abroad.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite its achievements, the protocol was weakened due to major emitters like the United States
                    refusing to ratify it. It was eventually superseded by the Paris Agreement, which includes all
                    countries in the fight against climate change.</p>

                    sea levels, and ecosystem disruptions.</p>
                <p>The agreement functions on a five-year cycle, where nations submit updated Nationally Determined
                    Contributions (NDCs)—outlining their emission reduction plans and adaptation strategies. The first
                    "global stocktake" in 2023, held at COP28, assessed global progress and reinforced commitments
                    toward phasing out fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy.</p>
                <p>Recognizing the disparities in resources among countries, the Paris Agreement establishes a financial
                    support system for developing nations to help them mitigate emissions, enhance resilience, and adapt
                    to climate impacts. Developed nations play a key role in funding and technological support.
                    Furthermore, the agreement enforces a transparent framework for monitoring and reporting emissions,
                    ensuring accountability in climate commitments.</p>
                <p>The Paris Agreement came into force on November 4, 2016, and has been ratified by 195 Parties (194
                    states and the European Union), marking a collective global effort to transition towards a net-zero
