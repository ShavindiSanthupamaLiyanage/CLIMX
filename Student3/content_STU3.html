            <h2 id="activity">2. Community and Individual Activities</h2>
            <p>Effective climate action must be inclusive, addressing the interconnected challenges of health, equity, and environmental sustainability. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and C40 Cities have supported six U.S. cities in tackling climate change through community-driven solutions. These cities, shaped by histories of industrialization and environmental injustice, are leveraging local activism to implement innovative programs that mitigate climate risks, promote public health, and advance social equity.</p>
            <h3>How Cities are Addressing Health, Equity, and Climate Change</h3>
            <p>Health, equity, and climate risks are deeply interconnected challenges that cities around the world must address. At RWJF and C40 Cities, we believe in sharing innovative solutions globally. Our grantees have successfully adapted proven strategies from cities in the Philippines, New Zealand, Brazil, and beyond—introducing community gardens, composting pilots, and resident advisory groups to combat climate-related health impacts.</p>
            <h4>Key Lessons from Community-Driven Climate Action</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inclusive climate action requires more than town hall meetings.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Strong relationships with local stakeholders matter.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Meet the community where they are</strong></li>
                <li><strong>ducation and awareness drive lasting change</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Communities can turn challenges into strengths</strong></li>
